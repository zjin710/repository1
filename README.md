# Assignment Repository

This repository contains the complete code for our group assignment, developed collaboratively by four students, each representing a distinct role:

- **Admin**
- **Lecturer**
- **Project Manager**
- **Student**

## Overview

The codebase is structured to reflect the contributions of each team member, with individual folders designated for each role stored in the `src` directory of the master page.
Text files used by all roles are saved in the `txtfiles` directory of the master page.

### My Contribution

I was responsible for developing the **Admin** part of the assignment and the compilation of code from each roles. While my main focus was on the Admin functionalities, 
I also contributed ideas and suggestions to enhance the roles of the Lecturer, Project Manager, and Student. 
This collaborative effort allowed us to create a more cohesive and comprehensive project.
